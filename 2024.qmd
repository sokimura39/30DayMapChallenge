# 2024 {.unnumbered}

Maps I have created for the [\#30DayMapChallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/)  2024.

This year more focus was given toward interactive maps, exploring new tools such as Blender, and new approaches like collaboration.

## Gallery

The interactive maps are as follows:

| Day | Theme | Title |
| ---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Points | [Cycle Hire Points in Japan]( https://sokimura39.github.io/odpt_data_map/cycles.html) |
| 12 | Time and Space | [Rail Duration Map]( https://sokimura39.github.io/odpt_data_map/durations.html) |
| 16 | Choropleth | [National Regional Allowance Map]( https://sokimura39.github.io/salary_map/) |

: Interactive maps made for the \#30DayMapChallenge 2024

I have also made some static maps using Illstrator, Blender, Python and a bit of AI.
