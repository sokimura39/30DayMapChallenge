# 30DayMapChallenge

This is my contribution to the #30DayMapChallenge for November 2023.\
About the #30DayMapChallenge , check out <https://30daymapchallenge.com/> !

## Introduction

### About me

I am a postgraduate student studying GIS and data science at UCL, trying to learn R, python, and making use of GitHub.\
Background in planning, new to London from Japan, some knowledge about QGIS, and interested in graphic design (trying to make the maps as aesthetic as possible!)

### This repository is:

-   where I will be uploading my maps!
-   where I will be uploading my code as well
-   my first public repository on GitHub
-   my first project using R and python

The data itself will not be uploaded due to limitations in file size, but I will try to be as reproducible as possible (but this might happen later.)

### My goals

Through the #30DayMapChallenge I want to: - be more familiar with R and python to draw maps using code. I will try to stay away from QGIS and Illustrator, although it is tempting to use them... - also be familiar with other software that I don't know. Blender might be one of them. - know more about London, the UK and Europe. The datasets will probably feature London and surrounding areas a lot. Some data might come from Japan. - know where to get data. Any recommendations are appreciated!

## The Maps

### Day 10: North America
![Traffic Direction in NYC](Maps/Day10.png)

When I was in elementary school, I used to live in Westchester County just north of New York City. Back then I didn't know about this field of GIS or geography (well I did spend some time playing SimCity, if that counts), so I decided to revisit New York with a geospatial lens!

The grid in Manhattan is famous for its one-way throughfare, and I mapped the rare exceptions that did carry both ways of traffic. (Yes I did not drive back then as well.)

Seems like NYC has a decent set of open geospatial data to explore...

### Day 9: Hexagons
![AirBNBs in London](Maps/Day09.png)

Analysis using hexagons is totally new to me. When I was doing my undergraduate in Japan, the only grids we used were the square ones.  
As explained [here](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/h-whyhexagons.htm) there seems to be advantages, so I decided to give a shot.  

I mapped the number of AirBNBs in each hexagonal grid of 350 meters across.
Did some basic spatial joins, but did not expect over 200 listings in a single cell!  

Just having a dark background makes the maps a lot cooler, but my interest toward graphic design makes me want to make cool maps using a lighter theme....

### Day 8: Africa

![African Cities by Population](Maps/Day08.png)

I have never engaged with African Geospatial Data before, so I tried mapping the population of major African cities.  
ArcGIS Hub does have a lot of data, which is appreciated a lot!

Now that I have a full week of mapping code ready, it is starting to get easier to create maps using the data I already have. Now this is reproducibility!

### Day 7: Navigation

![Cycle Navigation](Maps/Day07.png)

Wayfinding was always my interest, and this seemed like a perfect time to try!  
I have created my version of the [Legible London](https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/boroughs-and-communities/legible-london) signs with a focus on cycle maps!  

I have made this map with QGIS for the first time in this challenge. (No codes today!)
After a week of tackling data with R, I now really appreciate the GUI of QGIS.  
(Even simple things like rotating views was hard to figure out in R.)  
I also tried a new basemap: Carto tiles!

### Day 6: Asia

![Airports in Asia](Maps/Day06.png)

When I think about Asia, what comes to my mind are the huge airports competing against each other for size, efficiency, and the status as the world hub.  
I have mapped the 50 largest airport by annual passengers, with labeling the top 5.  
Dealing with text using ggplot2 is still difficult for me.  

I sourced Wikipedia since no others came handy, but felt like I was betraying all my past teachers! Sorry prof!

### Day 5: Analog Map

![Mental Map of London](Maps/Day05.png)

For an analog map, I made a map of London - in a way I understand it!  
Inspired by **"The Image of the City"** I tried to draw what I know about the city, and how each component affects how I perceive it.  
Few things I noticed:
- Inside or outside of the Ring Road is a big deal to me, crossing it is another big deal (every day I do!)
- The roads and rail do help me a lot when it comes to recognition
- Cycling around the city did help me a lot!
- I know too little about the east
- I know too little about the south

I hope I get to know this city a little better in the near future!

### Day 4: A Bad Map

![Imaginary London Sites](Maps/Day04.png)

Okay, a bad map.  
I decided to make a map with the wrong information: fake must-see spots within London!  
I asked ChatGPt to make up some spots to recommend to an innocent tourist!
It must believe that steampunk is something really big in London.
ChatGPT has made up a description for me as well. Everything is so WRONG!  
Enjoy your time in imaginary London!

### Day 3: Polygons

![English Green Belts](Maps/Day03.png)

Polygons lets you do everything, so I chose this theme because wanted the geometry of the polygon to speak for itself.  
The Green Belts in England is definitely something that characterizes its urban structure, and I mapped it! I didn't know there are so many cities with green belts around them.  
I also tried out the ggplot2 package to map today. I found it difficult to show texts the way I want it to, but maybe practice makes better!

### Day 2: Lines

![London Bus Routes](Maps/Day02.png)

The map for lines - the routes for the iconic double-decker (and single-decker) bus routes in London!  
The shaded area show the area of the 33 London Boroughs.  
The vast network covers most of London, and some routes go beyond to Slough and Dorking as well.

Credits for Transport for London again!  

I wanted to make a route diagram of the whole bus network (something like the tube network map) with all the routes drawn explicitly, but couldn't find a way to deal with the overlaps. Still illustrates the complexity of the network!

### Day 1: Points

![Santander Cycle Docking Stations in London](Maps/Day01.png)

For the very first day of my very first #30DayMapChallenge, I have mapped the docking stations for the Santander Cycle, a bike-sharing scheme in London.  
The points are colored according to the area name within the docking station name.
